# The Game
 * There's a hexagonal board full of tiles.
 * There's a number of players that are in the game.
 * There are the following hexagon types:
  * Star
  * Empty
 * Stars explode after a pre-defined number of turns, destroying everything on that tile.
 * The last player standing, wins.
 * Each player starts with 1 colony.
 * There are 2 resources: Metals, and Organics.
 * Each colony draws a card at the start of each turn.
 * The cards are as follows:
  * TODO, but these cards allow you to do actions.

## Foreseen Consequences of The Game
 * Games should snowball to victory for 1 player very quickly after some initial stalemate is broken.
 * Games can only last so long until all the stars explode.
